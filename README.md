# Open source your [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/java) exercises to GitHub
 
## Steps:
* Import the provided `Kotlin`&`Jsoup` script in `Idea`;
* Add your `CodingBat` `username` and `password` to the script (optionally followed by the number of exercises to skip);
  * or add them as arguments, in the same order;
* Run the main and wait for the output;
  * `git`, `gradle` and `bash` command will be generated (nothing is run), you can decide what to execute - linux only;
* Paste and run the content of the generated commands in the terminal, in the empty folder where you want the files to be placed;
* Sit back and relax while `git` is initialized, the solutions and tests are committed and a `Gradle` project structure is generated.
